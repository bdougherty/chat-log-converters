h1. Chat Log Converter Scripts

This is a collection of scripts for converting chat logs from one program to another.

*Make sure you back up your logs before running any of these scripts!*

h2. Colloquy to Adium

The latest "Adium":http://beta.adium.im beta includes support for IRC and I wanted to convert my "Colloquy":http://colloquy.info/ transcripts so that I could view them in Adium.

h3. Usage

@ruby colloquy-to-adium.rb -n nickname@

The only required argument is @-n@ which represents your default IRC nickname if the script can't figure it out from the logfile.

The script is preconfigured to use the default log paths for Adium and Colloquy, but you can change them if you want (@-i@ and @-o@ - see the help for details).
